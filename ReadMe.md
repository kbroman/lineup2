[R/lineup2](https://github.com/kbroman/lineup2) is an
[R](https://www.r-project.org) package with tools for detecting and
correcting sample mix-ups between two sets of measurements, such as
between gene expression data on two tissues. It's a revised
version of [lineup](https://github.com/kbroman/lineup), to be more
general and not so closely tied to the [R/qtl](http://rqtl.org)
package.
